🚪 Campus Access – Digital Gate Pass System
📌 Overview

The Campus Access App is a modern solution designed to replace the traditional paper-based gate pass system used in colleges. This application allows students to request gate passes digitally, while faculty and security can approve, track, and verify passes in real time.

The system improves security, transparency, and efficiency by maintaining a centralized digital record of all entry and exit permissions.
